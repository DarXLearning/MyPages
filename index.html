    <h6>The Prophet said:</h6>
    <p> "Whoever fasts Ramadan, then follows it up with 6 fasts in Shawwāl, it is as if he has fasted the whole year."
    <h6>Shahih Muslim [1164] </h6>

Al-Hafidh al-Nawawi رحمه الله said:

"The scholars have said it is as if one has fasted the whole year because good deeds are multiplied 10 fold; so Ramadan equals 10 months and 6 days (from Shawwal) equals 2 months."

Al-Minhaj 4/297

Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Şalih al-Uthaymin رحمه الله said:

"It is better that the six fasts from Shawwal are

consecutive and that they are directly after 'Eid

al-Fitr; due to what that contains from

hastening to good."
